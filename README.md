# ETC – Escape The Code

**ETC (Escape The Code)** is a gamified platform for learning programming skills, designed as an interactive escape room challenge. Each user navigates through themed "houses" and "rooms," unlocking new concepts by solving coding challenges and discovering resources.

**NOTE:** This is just a prototype which I made with my friends to participate in the **LJ Innovation Village 2025** and thankfully we received a good response by the audience which consisted of students, professors and tech community :)

## Features
- 🏠 **Gamified Learning**: Each house represents a skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).
- 🚪 **Concept-Based Rooms**: Each room focuses on a specific programming concept.
- 🧩 **Interactive Challenges**: Solve coding puzzles to unlock the next room.
- 📚 **Curated Resources**: Clues and hints provide learning materials.
- 🏆 **Capstone Projects**: Advanced levels include guided and project-based learning.
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Designed as a 2D Unity mobile project.

## Gameplay Flow
1. Choose a skill house (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).
2. Enter rooms where each coding concept is introduced.
3. Collect resources (clues) and solve coding challenges.
4. Earn points and unlock the next room.
5. Progress to higher houses for tougher challenges.
6. Complete advanced projects to master skills.

## Built With
- **Unity (2D)** – Game engine for interactive scenes.
